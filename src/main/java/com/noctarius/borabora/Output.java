 * An <tt>Output</tt> instance represents a target sink for writeable data. Output implementations

 * a non side-effect free situation. Whereas most implementations don't necessarily need to
 * use the provided <tt>offset</tt> which is passed to <tt>write</tt> methods, it can be used
 * to prevent storing internal offsets. As all writes coming from the generators are in order
 * and immediate, the offset is constantly increasing only and does not need random pokes.
 * <p>A common basic example for the usage of <tt>Output</tt> looks like:</p>
 * <pre>
 *     Output output = Output.toCompositeBuffer( ... );
 *     Writer writer = Writer.newWriter();
 *     GraphBuilder graphBuilder = writer.newGraphBuilder( output );
 *     // generate the actual data stream
