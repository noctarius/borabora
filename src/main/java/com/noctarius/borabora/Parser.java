/**
 * <p>The <tt>Parser</tt> class is the entry point for all parsing related activities. This includes element
 * query, as well as any kind of CBOR encoded stream extraction. The parser is implemented as a so-called
 * skip-scan parser, reading the type and length of an element and skipping right over when it is not
 * needed and further necessary. Returned {@link Value} instances are fully lazily read whenever the
 * actual represented value is requested.</p>
 * <p><tt>Parser</tt> implementation is thread-safe and stateless, therefore a single parser instance
 * can be shared and used concurrently by multiple threads.</p>
 * <p>A common example how to query an element from the CBOR stream is shown in the following snippet:</p>
 * <pre>
 *     Parser parser = Parser.newParser();
 *     Input input = Input.fromByteArray( getByteArray() );
 *     Query query = parser.newQueryBuilder().stream( 0 ).sequence( 10 ).build();
 *     Value value = parser.read( input, query );
 * </pre>

 * @see Query
