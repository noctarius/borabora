/**
 * The <tt>PipelineStage</tt> interface defines a single point of execution inside a query execution plan.
 * <p>PipelineStages are grouped into a {@link QueryPipeline} and designed as a binary tree. The default
 * implementation utilizes a LCRS (Left Child Right Sibling) tree which is easy to traverse (preOrder traversal).</p>
 * <p>PipelineStage implementations are considered to be immutable and all accessing code is meant to
 * work in the assumption that this holds true. Furthermore {@link #left()} or {@link #right()} are not
 * allowed to return <tt>null</tt> but an end stage has to be signalled by returning {@link #NIL} from
 * either or both of the above methods.</p>
 * <p>{@link #stage()} on the other side is allowed to return <tt>null</tt>, however this is considered
 * to be a corner case and non of the default operations takes this possibility.</p>
 * <p>Overall the PipelineStage and QueryPipeline employ the Visitor pattern to implement the execution
 * plan and the overall query execution. {@link VisitResult} is used to control the query flow and to
 * {@link VisitResult#Break} from the current query path, {@link VisitResult#Continue} it,
 * {@link VisitResult#Exit} from the query altogether, or {@link VisitResult#Loop} on the current
 * pipeline stage.</p>
