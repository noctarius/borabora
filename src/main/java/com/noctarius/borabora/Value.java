 * A <tt>Value</tt> represents a known or unknown data item in borabora. While CBOR is type-safe in terms
 * of data items, it is schema-less overall, or better said the schema is defined by the elements inside
 * the stream itself. To prevent deserialization, borabora does not tries to validate any of the elements
 * before it actually is request to do so explicitly.
 * <p>Value for this sake serves as a container storing the offset and found {@link MajorType} and
 * {@link ValueType}. It is up to the user to extract the actual data item's value itself.</p>
 * <p>If the value does not match or is not transformable into the requested type of value, borabora
 * will throw a {@link WrongTypeException}.</p>
 * <p>A common usage example is shown in the following snippet:</p>
 * <pre>
 *     Value value = parser.read( input, query );
 *     stringBuilder.append( value.string() );
 * </pre>
 * <p>This extracts the actual data item's value represented by the <tt>value</tt> instance as a string
 * and appends it to the given string builder.</p>
