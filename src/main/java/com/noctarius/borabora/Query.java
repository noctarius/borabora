/**
 * The <tt>Query</tt> interface represents any kind of prepared statement like query to be
 * executed against any of the {@link Parser} data querying or extraction methods. Query
 * instances can be created by either of the following ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Parser#prepareQuery(String)}</li>
 * <li>{@link Parser#newQueryBuilder()} and {@link QueryBuilder#build()}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>The resulting Query instances of any of the above ways are fully stateless and
 * thread-safe and can be used concurrently by multiple threads and stored into static
 * final fields without any further issues.</p>
 * <p>A common example how to query an element from the CBOR stream is shown in the following snippet:</p>
 * <pre>
 *     Parser parser = Parser.newParser();
 *     Input input = Input.fromByteArray( getByteArray() );
 *     Query query = parser.newQueryBuilder().stream( 0 ).sequence( 10 ).build();
 *     Value value = parser.read( input, query );
 * </pre>
